### Version: 0.4.0

### Changelog
As of `0.4`, we've decide a changelog is in order, because `0.4` starts adding multiple features at once.

#### 0.4
- Adds categories for posting, with a default category of "General Discussions"
- Adds a permission system
 - Default permissions are for guests to view only, and members to post in all categories.  Once more functionality is added, a permission manager will be implemented to allow for more categories access control.
- Adds an online user list to the sidebar.
- Added functionality to log out once logged in.
- Adds a registration script, so users don't have to manually be input.
- Tags all topics with the appropriate topic starter.
- Tags all posts with the appropriate post author.
